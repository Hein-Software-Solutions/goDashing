# Changelog

## v0.0.1 - Running version (again)
After the previous maintainer has fixed the errors so it compiled, five years of inactivity led to new incompatible source code with new versions of Go.

Now all errors are fixed and the source code is partly restructured and cleaned up.

A GitHub action will now create executables for each OS if a new tag is pushed.
